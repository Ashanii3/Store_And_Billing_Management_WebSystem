# Store and Billing Management Web System 

This project is an e-commerce website developed for the "KidsPlanet" shop. Fundamentally, there are two modules on this website: the admin module and the customer module.

Customers will be able to purchase items in multiple categories after logging in, and each customer will have a separate dynamic profile page to track their order details and account details.
The admin module contains access to the admin profile on the website. Every data received by the admin profile will be updated dynamically, and vice versa.

The website is very user-friendly and attractive, providing comfort to the end users.
